* Introduction

An ~emacs~ global minor mode that delegate window management to ~i3wm~.

* Installation

0. this package depends on [[https://github.com/davidshepherd7/frames-only-mode][frames-only-mode]], which modifies ~display-buffer-alist~ to use frames instead of windows to display buffer
1. download ~i3.el~ to your ~load-path~ then
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
     (require 'i3)
   #+end_src

One advantage of this package is allow you use an unified set of hotkeys to move window focus both within emacs, by calling ~windmove~ commands, and also across x-windows, by calling ~i3-msg focus~ commands. To use this feature, you need to

1. put ~move-focus~ to somewhere in your ~PATH~
2. update the i3 config file to allow
   #+begin_src bash
     bindsym YOUR-PREFERRED-KEY exec --no-startup-id "move-focus left"
     bindsym YOUR-PREFERRED-KEY exec --no-startup-id "move-focus down"
     bindsym YOUR-PREFERRED-KEY exec --no-startup-id "move-focus up"
     bindsym YOUR-PREFERRED-KEY exec --no-startup-id "move-focus right"
    #+end_src

* Usage
Call ~i3-mode~

* TODO list
- ~split-window-preferred-function~ is not respected since we do not use window anymore
- how to deal with ~magit~ mode?
