* Introduction

An ~emacs~ global minor mode that delegates window management to ~i3wm~.

The program uses ~i3-msg~ to communicate with the window manager. It may not be compatible with other window manager.

* Installation


* Idea

This package overrides ~split-window~ to split frames instead. Some modes/functions like ~transient~ do not play well with switching focus between frames. The customization option ~i3-function-should-split-window~ allows those modes/functions to continue using the original ~split-window~ to do their businesses. If there is another function that you want to split window rather than frame, you can add that function to ~i3-function-should-split-window~.
